# Polymer Starter Project

This is a finished version of the [Polymer Starter Project](http://polymer-project.org/start/tutorial/intro.html)

I've tried to add comments as I went through the tutorial but may come back to elaborate as I explore more.

I'm also hoping to add more demo apps to this repo, probably recreating some examples from [Google's new Design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)

## Project contents

 -   `starter`. My commented version of the Polymer Starter Project
 -   `components`. Selection of Polymer elements used in the project.
 -   `post-service`. A pre-built element that implements an interface to the `unquote` service. 
 -   `api`. Data for the the `unquote` service.
 -   `images`. Avatar images.
